CHARLEY
It's getting dark, Linda.
(Linda doesn't react. LINDA stares at the grave.)

BIFF
How about it, Mom? Better get some rest, heh? They'll be closing the gate soon.
(Pause.)

HAPPY
(deeply angered)
He had no right to do that. There was no necessity for it. We would've helped him.

CHARLEY
(grunting)
Hmmm.

BIFF
Come along, Mom.

LINDA
Why didn't anybody come?

CHARLEY
It was a very nice funeral.

LINDA
But where are all the people he knew? Maybe they blame him.

CHARLEY
Naa. It's a rough world, Linda. They wouldn't blame him.

LINDA
I can't understand it. At this time especially. First time in thirty-five years we were just about free and clear. He only needed a little salary. He was even finished with the dentist.

CHARLEY
No man only needs a little salary.

LINDA
I can't understand it.

BIFF
There were a lot of nice days. When he'd come home from a trip; or on Sundays, making the stoop; finishing the cellar; putting on the new porch; when he built the extra bathroom; and put up the garage. You know something, Charley, there's more of him in that front stoop than in all the sales he ever made.

CHARLEY
Yeah. He was a happy man with a batch of cement.
(staring at grave)

LINDA
He was so wonderful with his hands.

BIFF
He had the wrong dreams. All, all, wrong.
(turns left)

HAPPY
(almost ready to fight Biff)
Don't say that!

BIFF
He never knew who he was.

CHARLEY
(turns left, raises left hand)
(stopping Happy's movement and reply. To Biff)
Nobody dast blame this man. You don't understand: Willy was a  salesman. And for a salesman, there is no rock bottom to the life. He don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you the law or give you medicine. He's man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a Shoeshine. 
And when they start not smiling back - that's an earthquake. And then you get yourself a couple of spots on your hat, and you're finished. Nobody dast blame this man. A salesman is got to dream, boy. It comes with the territory.

BIFF
(looks right, then looks left)
Charley, the man didn't know who he was.

HAPPY
(infuriated)
Don't say that!

BIFF
Why don't you come with me, Happy?

HAPPY
I'm not licked that easily. I'm staying right in this city, and I'm gonna beat this racket! 
(HAPPY looks at Biff, his chin set.)
The Loman Brothers!

BIFF
I know who I am, kid.

HAPPY
(looks right)
All right, boy. I'm gonna show you and everybody else that Willy Loman did not die in vain. He had a good dream. It's the only dream you can have - to come out number-one man. He fought it out here, and this is where I'm gonna win it for him.

BIFF 
Let's go, Mom.
(touches LINDA, walks away)

LINDA
I'll be with you in a minute. Go on, Charley. 
(He hesitates.)
(Charley hugs Linda)
I want to, just for a minute. I never had a chance to say good-by.
(Charley moves away, CHARLEY is followed by Happy.)
(Bernard also follows Charley)
(She looks at the grave.)

LINDA
Forgive me, dear. I can't cry. I don't know what it is, I can't cry. I don't understand it. Why did you ever do that? Help me Willy, I can't cry. It seems to me that you're just on another trip. I keep expecting you. Willy, dear, I can't cry. Why did you do it? I search and search and I search, and I can't understand it, Willy. I made the last payment on the house today. Today, dear. And there'll be nobody home. 
(A sob rises in her throat.)
We're free and clear. 
(Sobbing more fully, released.) 
We're free.
We're free... We're free... 
(She moves stageright. Linda sobs quietly.)
