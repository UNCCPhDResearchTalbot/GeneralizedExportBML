(At the door) 
Mother asks if you will stop them cutting down the orchard until she has gone away.

TROFIMOV
Yes, really, you ought to have enough tact not to do that.

LOPAKHIN
All right, all right . . . yes, he's right. 
(Exit.)

ANYA
Has Fiers been sent to the hospital?

YASHA
I gave the order this morning. I suppose they've sent him.

ANYA
(To EPIKHODOV, who crosses the room) 
Simeon Panteleyevitch, please make inquiries if Fiers has been sent to the hospital.

YASHA
(Offended) 
I told Egor this morning. What's the use of asking ten times!

EPIKHODOV
The aged Fiers, in my conclusive opinion, isn't worth mending; his forefathers had better have him. I only envy him. 
(Puts a trunk on a hatbox and squashes it) 
Well, of course. I thought so! 
(Exit.)

YASHA
(Grinning) 
Two-and-twenty troubles.

VARYA
(Behind the door) 
Has Fiers been taken away to the hospital?

ANYA
Yes.

VARYA
Why didn't they take the letter to the doctor?

ANYA
It'll have to be sent after him. 
(Exit.)
