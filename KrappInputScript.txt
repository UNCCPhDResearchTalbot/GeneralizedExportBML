(KRAPP comes back into light carrying an old ledger and sits down at table. KRAPP lays ledger on table, wipes his mouth, wipes his hands on the front of his waistcoat, brings them smartly together and rubs them.)

Ah! 
(KRAPP bends over ledger, turns the pages, finds the entry he wants, reads.)

 Box three, spool five. 
 (He bends over the machine, looks up. With relish.) 
 Spooool! 
 (happy smile. He bends, loads spool on machine, rubs his hands.) 
 Ah! 
 (He peers at ledger, reads entry at foot of page.) 
 Mother at rest at last . . . Hm . . . The black ball . . .
