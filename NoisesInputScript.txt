(Enter BROOKE through the FRONTDOOR. She is a desirable property in her early twenties, well-built and beautifully maintained throughout)

GARRY
So we've got the place entirely to ourselves.

LLOYD
Hold it, BROOKE. DOTTY!
(Enter DOTTY from the study)

DOTTY 
Come back?

LLOYD 
Yes, and go out again with the newspaper.

DOTTY 
The newspaper? Oh, the newspaper.

LLOYD 
You put the receiver back, you leave the sardines, and you go out with the newspaper.

GARRY 
Here you are, love.

DOTTY
Sorry, love. 

GARRY 
(embraces DOTTY) 
Don't worry, love. It's only the technical.

LLOYD 
It's the dress, Garry, honey. It's the dress rehearsal.

GARRY 
So when was the technical?

LLOYD 
So when's the dress? We open tomorrow! 

GARRY 
Well, we're all thinking of it as the technical. 

(To DOTTY) 

Aren't we, love?

DOTTY
It's all those words, my sweetheart. 

GARRY 
Don't worry about the words, Dotty, my pet.

DOTTY 
Coming up like oranges and lemons. 

GARRY 
Listen, Dotty, your words are fine, your words are better than the, do you know what I mean? 

(To BROOKE) 

Isn't that right?

BROOKE 
(her thoughts elsewhere) 
Sorry?

GARRY 
(to DOTTY) 
I mean, OK, so he's the, you know. Fine. But, Dotty, love, you've been playing this kind of part for, well, you know what I mean.

LLOYD 
All right? So Garry and Brooke are off, Dotty's holding the receiver...

GARRY 
No, but here we are, we're all thinking, my God, we open tomorrow, we've only had a fortnight to rehearse, we don't know where we are, but my God, here we are!

DOTTY 
That's right, my sweet. Isn't that right, Lloyd?

LLOYD 
Beautifully put, Garry. 

GARRY 
No, but we've got to play Weston-super-Mare all the rest of this week, then Yeovil, then God knows where, then God knows where else, and so on for God knows how long, and we're all of us feeling pretty much, you know... 

(To BROOKE) 

I mean, aren't you?

BROOKE 
Sorry? 

LLOYD 
Anyway, you're off, Dotty's holding the receiver ...

GARRY 
Sorry, Lloyd. But sometimes you just have to come right out with it. You know?

LLOYD 
I know.

GARRY 
Thanks, Lloyd. 

LLOYD 
OK, Garry. So you're off ... 

GARRY 
Lloyd, let me just say one thing. Since we've stopped. I've worked with a lot of directors, Lloyd. Some of them were geniuses. Some of them were bastards. But I've never met one who was so totally and absolutely... I don't know...

LLOYD 
Thank you, Garry. I'm very touched. Now will you get off the fucking stage?

(Exit GARRY through the FRONTDOOR)

And, BROOKE ...

BROOKE 
Yes? 

LLOYD 
Are you in? 

BROOKE 
In?

LLOYD 
Are you there? 

BROOKE 
What? 

LLOYD 
You're out. OK. I'll call again. And on we go.

(Exit BROOKE through the FRONTDOOR)
